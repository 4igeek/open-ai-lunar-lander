# open-ai-lunar-lander
A very crude solution to solving OpenAI lunar lander using NEAT (neuroevolution of augmenting topologies)

Set the `training_mode` variable at the top of main.py to determine if you want to train the model or use the saved model when running the program.

Once you've cloned, setup a local python environment and then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.

Once the dependencies are installed run `python main.py` to run the main program.
